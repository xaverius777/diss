Directory xaverius777/diss/testset contains the following:
+ Data - audio data used for the test set
+ Code - code used for generating the audio data and the surveys used to obtain CCR scores
+ testset.csv - the testset itself. Each row contains: path to audio A (noisy speech), path to audio B (enhanced speech), CCR MOS, the number of answers the human respondents provided and the answers themselves. To use the testset yourself, you have to use your own audio a audio b paths (if enough people want to use the test set, I'll upload a friendlier version). Shouldn't be hard, since you got the basenames, which are the files you can download in diss/testset/data
