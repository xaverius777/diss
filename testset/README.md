Directory xaverius777/diss/testset contains the following:
+ Data - audio data used for the test set
+ Code - code used for generating the audio data and the surveys used to obtain CCR scores
+ testset.csv - the testset itself. Each row contains: path to audio A (noisy speech), path to audio B (enhanced speech), CCR MOS, the number of answers the human respondents provided and the answers themselves. To use the testset yourself, you would have to replace my paths with your paths.
